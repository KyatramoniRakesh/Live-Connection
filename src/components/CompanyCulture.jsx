            Our culture has always been defined by transparent, employee friendly
            policies. LiveC believes in flat hierarchies, where every individual
            is valued and nurtured. We have a high performing team where creativity
            is actively encouraged. We champion social causes and value any
            participation in such causes. With more youngsters streaming into the
            workforce, we are constantly adapting to match the needs of different
            generations that work at LiveC.
