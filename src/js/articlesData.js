      "There is a war for talent in Urban cities. This article about the immense talent available in Rural India! Most corporates are refining interviewing strategies instead of tweaking sourcing strategies.",

    content: [
      "You must have come across articles on “How to nail that interview”, “5 questions one should never ask at any interview”, “Tips for grooming for an interview” etc. All these blogs are intended to help the job seeker. It is assumed that the employer is at an advantage. Not true for SME’s like the one I run.",

      "Now, for some context, I own & run a mid-sized recruitment firm with over 500+ FTE’s. I always need to hire more, and quickly. We do weekend drives, talk to campus placements, post on social media, etc., in an effort to hire talent from the metros. The truth is, the cities have too many companies battling over too few. Every youngster who is smart, thinks logically and communicates well is strutting around with multiple job offers. This bidding war cannot work for SME’s such as us. So we decided not to bring the talent to our doorstep, but to go where the talent is.",

      "If the covid misery has taught us one thing, it is that we can work virtually. The slackers will always find water-cooler time even when they come to work. The sincere ones will always hunker down and battle with their goalposts, even if they work from home. The trick is to find that sincere player.",

      "And that brings me to the perils of hiring through the classical process of interviewing.",

      "How do I identify a sincere worker based on just 30–40 minutes of conversation? All candidates put on a good show, try and put their best foot forward. What are your strengths.. a voluminous list is spelt out. Your weaknesses? “Oh, I’ve always worked too hard”. “I am too modest..”. Today, youngsters are smart in saying what they think you want to hear. “Yes, I can work with difficult clients.” “Of course I can handle 12 hour days. Just bring it on”.",

      "I have studied body language. I have fine combed through their resume. I have trick-questioned. I have been aggressive, gentle, probing, cynical. But after 27 years in this biz, I am yet to arrive at the solution of “How to assess well in an interview”.",

      "At some point, I gave up trying to find an answer. There is no solution. No formula. Nothing. It can be a hit or a miss. Your best intuition about a candidate could go disastrously wrong a few months down the line. I decided if all interviews are just an honest attempt at stumbling in the dark, I may as well give up and blindly hire based on resumes.",

      "Until.....",

      "I began talking to candidates from upcountry locations. I recently interviewed a girl from Lalgudi. The nervousness I saw was a refreshing change from the practiced smoothness of a big city college student who has been polished through workshops. When she did not know the answer, she was honest enough to admit ignorance, which was alarmingly frequent. There was a definite economic need which added to her anxiety. There was no “take me or leave me” arrogance. What she lagged behind in communication skills, she made up for in authenticity.",

      "“Hire for attitude, train for skills” has been my mantra. So with the plethora of talent in upcountry locations — raw, unpolished diamonds such as they were — we set to work — to target talent from tier-3 cities and small towns.",

      "Luckily for me, our biz models lends itself well to remote working. So all we need to do is find those rough diamonds in Shimoga or Araku. A concerted drive to source from such markets paid off. As I write, this is an ongoing effort. An MBA/but housewife from Chattisgarh is one of my most productive employees till date. An account manager from Vijayawada in AP actually helped revive several lapsed Mumbai-based accounts. Geography is no bar to honesty.",

      "As a battle-scarred veteran in recruitment, I have realized that the youngsters in tier-3 cities & small towns do not need trick-questioning, behavioral assessment or deep probing. They are transparent and charmingly naïve. What you see is what you get. And in my opinion, what you get is pretty darned good!",

      "It took this pandemic for us to get creative in hiring.",

      "This is a call out to all those hiring managers of corporate India — there is immense, sincere talent available in rural India. Just look!"

      "Hiring hurdles faced by Fintech start-ups in India: A David-Goliath fight that can be won!",

      "Fintech start-ups face severe hiring challenges due to intense competition, high salaries, and talent shortages.",

    content: [
      "As a recruiter, I had to turn away business from a Fintech start-up recently. Partnering with such start-ups is challenging as hiring for them poses huge speedbumps. A Fintech start-up usually looks for niche talent that is highly valued in the market. The Goliaths in this market are massive international banks, Insurance giants, and FIIs setting up development centers in India. Fintech organizations that have turned Unicorns offer aggressive compensation too.",

      "Today, the knowledge economy talent market in India is exploding. Giant MNC’s across Retail, Banking, Insurance, Manufacturing & logistics are establishing their India footprint. A yawning gap in talent supply versus demand has resulted in spiraling salaries. We see candidates hopping around for multiple offers and corporates indulging them in what is almost a bidding war.",

      "A 3-year experienced candidate just saw his salary increase from 22 lakhs to 72 lakhs in through time — thanks to the multiple offers he kept getting throughout the interview process. The job market has gone berserk in its hiring and compensation strategies. In this world, a Fintech start-up trying to hire strong engineering talent and technology architects in choppy waters unless it gets innovative in hiring.",

      "Investing in a strong social media presence gets them mindspace with the right candidate. There must be a dedicated and consistent effort on all the relevant platforms to create a strong social media stamp. I know a start-up that used humor in their SMS messaging and their Recruitment team was flooded with resumes creating a unique supply line of talent!",

      "Gamification strategies help engage with candidates and keep them involved. Leaderboards, badges, tokens and a reward at the end gets a candidate who is passionate about technology quite excited. The recruitment team here has to collaborate with functional teams to keep rolling out such programs.",

      "A start-up must be creative in sourcing from different talent pools. Today, the gig economy is getting popular and has drawn in college students into the talent pool. An interested student (who can code, crunch data, or just brings common sense to the table), offers 4-5 hours of focused work per day, and can be used for grunt level work with the right kind of monitoring. A lot of experienced professionals are also exploring such options. I came across a Tech professional who was quitting his job to do a bar-tending course. This was after he was just given a 22% hike. So, while money is important, some of today’s youngsters feel that work-life balance is also critical. This bar tender Java architect was open to working a few hours per day. Part-time work and short-term contracts help woo such talent.",

      "A long-haul strategy is working with economically under-privileged youth and investing in their education. I know a successful start-up which used to invest time in training less privileged localities within the city. They created a dedicated and totally committed workforce by sponsoring high school and college education for some of the sharper kids. This company today has one of the lowest attrition rates too!",

      "A key takeaway from the pandemic is that working virtual works. A lot of companies are planning to offer a hybrid model (3 days office, 2 days home) from Jan 2022 onwards. Offering permanent WFH or work-from-wherever helps attract talent that a lot of regulated MNC banks cannot offer. Going forward, I believe a lot of start-ups will be using this as a differentiator while fighting with the goliaths to attract talent.",

      "As an extension of the WFH strategy, actively hiring from non-urban centers will also make a difference. The sincerity, positive attitude, gratitude for the job and commitment that rural talent offers, more than makes up for their lack of polish and suave interpersonal skills.",

      "Today recruitment firms are paid in an outcome-based model. A finder’s fee is given to them for every candidate who joins. With a 60% offer decline rate, this can be frustrating. A few companies are changing this by offering fees for Level-2 selects itself. Internal recruitment teams should also be incentivized for every joining. Functional leaders should be roped in for post-offer engagement with the selected candidate.",

      "Above all of this, as well known, money is a great leveler, Goliath or otherwise. Compensation should be attractive and today start-ups must be more creative on this front. Offering equity, tax-friendly components, allowances, and retention bonuses could help in fighting attrition-linked hiring.",

      "There is a war for talent out there. It’s not enough to have a bright idea and get funding. Fintech start-ups must get disruptive with hiring strategies too!",
